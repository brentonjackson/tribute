## Acknowledgments

I usually just have a thing for multiplayer games, as a middle child of five.
Coming across the Witcher 3 opened my eyes to the world of open-world single
player games. 

The Netflix series didn't focus on the main character as much
as I'd liked, so that gave me the inspiration to make this tribute page.
